	abstract = {GIFT, a lightweight block cipher proposed at CHES2017, has been widely cryptanalyzed this years. This paper studies the differential diffusion characteristics of round function of GIFT at first, and proposes a random nibble-based differential fault attack. The key recovery scheme is developed on the statistical properties we found for the differential distribution table of the S-box. A lot of experiments had been done and experimental results show that one round key can be retrieved with an average of 20.24 and 44.96 fault injections for GIFT-64 and GIFT-128 respectively. Further analysis shows that a certain number of fault injections recover most key bits. So we demonstrate an improved fault attack combined with the method of exhaustive search, which shows that the master key can be recovered by performing 216 and 217 computations and injecting 31 and 32 faults on an average for GIFT-64 and GIFT-128 respectively.},

abstract = {In this study, the authors propose an accurate approach to model the propagation of the division property of linear layers by the smallest amount of inequalities. The solutions of the inequalities are exactly the division trails of a linear transformation. Therefore, the description is compact and optimal. As applications of their results, they present a 7-round integral distinguisher for both Midori64 and Midori128. The designers of Midori only obtained a 3.5-round integral characteristic. For Skinny64, they find a 10-round integral distinguisher which was previously found by the designers. It is well to remind that their result proves that 7 rounds and 10 rounds are the upper bounds of Midori and Skinny64 correspondingly when searching for integral distinguishers based on division property. The significance of their result lies in that they shed light on how far division cryptanalysis can influence the security analysis of block ciphers with a binary diffusion layer, and their technique can be used to prove security against division cryptanalysis.},

Recently, automatic search tools have become one of the most popular approaches to evaluating the security of designs against many attacks. Constraint-aided automatic tools for the BDP have been applied to many ciphers with simple linear layers like bit-permutation. Constructing models of complex linear layers accurately and efficiently remains hard. A straightforward method proposed by Sun &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; (called the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; method), decomposes a complex linear layer into basic operations like COPY and XOR, then models them one by one. However, this method can easily insert invalid division trails into the solution pool, which results in a quicker loss of the balanced property than the cipher itself would. In order to solve this problem, Zhang and Rijmen propose the &lt;em&gt;ZR&lt;/em&gt; method to link every valid trail with an invertible sub-matrix of the matrix corresponding to the linear layer, and then generate linear inequalities to represent all the invertible sub-matrices. Unfortunately, the &lt;em&gt;ZR&lt;/em&gt; method is only applicable to invertible binary matrices (defined in Definition 3).&lt;br&gt;To avoid generating a huge number of inequalities for all the sub-matrices, we build a new model that only includes that the sub-matrix corresponding to a valid trail should be invertible. The computing scale of our model can be tackled by most of SMT/SAT solvers, which makes our method practical. For applications, we improve the previous BDP for LED and MISTY1. We also give the 7-round BDP results for Camellia with &lt;em&gt;FL&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;FL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the longest to date.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, we remove the restriction of the &lt;em&gt;ZR&lt;/em&gt; method that the matrix has to be invertible, which provides more choices for future designs. Thanks to this, we also reproduce 5-round key-dependent integral distinguishers proposed at Crypto 2016 which cannot be obtained by either the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ZR&lt;/em&gt; methods.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={1}, journal={IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology}, author={Hu, Kai and Wang, Qingju and Wang, Meiqin}, year={2020}, pages={396-424} }
@article{SuGe17, title={Analysis of AES, SKINNY, and Others with Constraint Programming}, volume={2017}, abstractNote={Search for different types of distinguishers are common tasks in symmetrickey cryptanalysis. In this work, we employ the constraint programming (CP) technique to tackle such problems. First, we show that a simple application of the CP approach proposed by Gerault &lt;em&gt;et al. &lt;/em&gt;leads to the solution of the open problem of determining the exact lower bound of the number of active S-boxes for 6-round AES-128 in the related-key model. Subsequently, we show that the same approach can be applied in searching for integral distinguishers, impossible differentials, zero-correlation linear approximations, in both the single-key and related-(twea)key model. We implement the method using the open source constraint solver Choco and apply it to the block ciphers PRESENT, SKINNY, and HIGHT (ARX construction). As a result, we find 16 related-tweakey impossible differentials for 12-round SKINNY-64-128 based on which we construct an 18-round attack on SKINNY-64-128 (one target version for the crypto competition &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/skinnycipher&quot;&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/skinnycipher&lt;/a&#38;gt; announced at ASK 2016). Moreover, we show that in some cases, when equipped with proper strategies (ordering heuristic, restart and dynamic branching strategy), the CP approach can be very efficient. Therefore, we suggest that the constraint programming technique should become a convenient tool at hand of the symmetric-key cryptanalysts.}, number={1}, journal={IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology}, author={Sun, Siwei and Gerault, David and Lafourcade, Pascal and Yang, Qianqian and Todo, Yosuke and Qiao, Kexin and Hu, Lei}, year={2017}, pages={281-306} }

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

Solvers based on SMT are used as back-end engines in model-checking applications such as bounded, interpolation-based, and predicate-abstraction-based model checking. After a brief illustration of these uses, we survey the predominant techniques for solving SMT problems with an emphasis on the lazy approach, in which a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver is combined with one or more theory solvers. We discuss the architecture of a lazy SMT solver, give examples of theory solvers, show how to combine such solvers modularly, and mention several extensions of the lazy approach. We also briefly describe the eager approach in which the SMT problem is reduced to a SAT problem. Finally, we discuss how the basic framework for determining satisfiability can be extended with additional functionality such as producing models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.",

abstract = {Combinatorial Optimization is an important area of computer science that has many theoretical and practical applications. In the thesis [Chu, 2011], we present important contributions to several different areas of combinatorial optimization, including nogood learning, symmetry breaking, dominance, relaxations and parallelization. We develop a new nogood learning technique based on constraint projection that allows us to exploit subproblem dominances that arise when two different search paths lead to subproblems which are identical on the remaining unfixed variables. We present a new symmetry breaking technique called SBDS-1UIP, which extends Symmetry Breaking During Search (SBDS) by using the more powerful 1UIP nogoods generated by Lazy Clause Generation (LCG) solvers. We present two new general methods for exploiting almost symmetries by modifying SBDS-1UIP and by using conditional symmetry breaking constraints. We solve the Minimization of Open Stacks Problem, the Talent Scheduling Problem (CSPLib prob039), and the Maximum Density Still Life Problem (CSPLib prob032) many orders of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art by applying various powerful techniques such as nogood learning, dynamic programming, dominance and relaxations. We present cache aware data structures for SAT solvers which allows sequential and parallel versions of SAT solvers to run more quickly. And we present a new load balancing scheme for parallel search called confidence based work stealing, which allows the parallel search to make use of the information contained in the branching heuristic.},

abstract="Lazy clause generation is a powerful hybrid approach to combinatorial optimization that combines features from SAT solving and finite domain (FD) propagation. In lazy clause generation finite domain propagators are considered as clause generators that create a SAT description of their behaviour for a SAT solver. The ability of the SAT solver to explain and record failure and perform conflict directed backjumping are then applicable to FD problems. The original implementation of lazy clause generation was constructed as a cut down finite domain propagation engine inside a SAT solver. In this paper we show how to engineer a lazy clause generation solver by embedding a SAT solver inside an FD solver. The resulting solver is flexible, efficient and easy to use. We give experiments illustrating the effect of different design choices in engineering the solver.",
